Each color is represented by an index from a limited color palette. The model picks from one of these colors (including air) as its output.\n\nThe training example sculptures are stored in .vox format. I then convert them to json and perform data augmentation by shifting their color. (I plan in the future to also perform random transformations.) Voxels are then encoded using their hsv values as well as their xyz spatial position.\n\nI am as of yet unable to get the model to learn complex patterns. While it can learn very simple patterns (like recreating a single sculpture from the training data), it is unable to generate brand new sculptures. I theorize this is due to an insufficient number of training examples and I am currently looking into ways to obtain/generate more.\n\nImplemented using Tensorflow and Keras.",

The goal was to let a user generate pixel images by giving feedback to a model that trains in real time. The premise was to have two networks: The generator and the judge. The user would rate images generated by the generator from one to five stars. This rating would then be used as a training example for the judge, which, given an image, would try to guess what star rating the user gave it. The generator would then try to generate images that score highly from the judge by backpropogating through the judge in a similar manner to GAN's. The main problem was that choosing the better of two random pixel noise images is rather difficult since it's rare that either of them will look enough like the target image for the rating to be meaningful. Additionally, the generator model would become far too focused on recreating any image that was rated positively by the user. Although the latter problem might be solved by limiting the generator's learning rate. Implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.",

Groverburger did most of the gameplay while I did the procedural generation. It uses layered cellular automata to create random caves and the diamond-square algorithm to create terrain. It then chooses a random start and end point and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest traversable path between the two so it can mark the path for the player. (If none can be found, it will carve a straight trench between a random point reachable from the start and a random point that can reach the end.) Then if the path is too long to reach (decided by the difficulty of the level), it will move the flag farther forward.

Six maps were submitted with textures made by ten people.\n\nThe map I submitted was called The Rocket Crusade. I continued my fascination with open-ended level design by making a map where you choose your own start point. The level begins with you shooting out of a cannon to land anywhere on the castle you wish. Then you must explore the castle, scrounging for powerups, weapons, and keys. The castle is gigantic and has tons of nooks and crannies to explore. I am particularly proud of the placement of the secrets, which reward the player for paying attention to the level structure and trying to access esoteric parts of the level geometry.",

                "description": "I hosted the SM205 speedmap event with the premise that participants are given restrictions for their map from a randomizer Python script I wrote. The randomizer tells the participant which entities they must use plus an additional special requirement.\n\nThe map I submitted was called The Infinite Garage. It's a total gimmick map that takes place on a grid of openable and closeable doors. I got the requirement of 8 Explosive Crates. When brainstorming ideas, I thought of using them to trigger shootable buttons. That eventually evolved into this map. The player carves their way through until they find both keys and the exit. The unofficial secret goal is to open every door in the level, a task that has a certain catharsis to it.",

The map could, however, be as tall as it wanted. In fact, my map takes up the entire vertical space a Quake map is allowed without expanded limits.\n\nThe map is essentially one long \"Romero Lift\" (a slow moving platform that you must ride while monsters drop in from above.) It constantly spawns new enemies above the player that they must fend off until the laser-grid floor lowers down to next checkpoint. All the while, the level geometry is changing as new obstacles phase through the floor and into the immediate playable space. In order to pace the level out, the elevator stops twice during the level. The player must go through a teleporter taking them to a side room where they must press a switch that re-enables the elevator. These side rooms are much slower paced in order to give the player a break from the frantic action of the elevator sections.\n\nThe third and final section of the elevator makes the greatest use of the changing obstacles by making the level constantly morph and shift until a well-timed Quad Damage drops from the ceiling. At the end, the level splits into four divided sections while monsters continue to spawn in the other three. The monsters continue to build up until the walls disappear completely and the player must fight all of them with their waning Quad Damage.\n\nThis is my favorite level I have designed for Quake.",

Mapmakers could spend those two hours whenever they wanted over a three day period, and could even make multiple submissions, but each map could only have two hours spent on it. 76 maps were submitted in total. My job was to decide the order for each map, recompile them to link the maps together, and fix any bugs.\n\nI ended up creating eight maps as submissions. The Mortal Coil, Starship Cthon, Top of the Castle, Spires Aplenty, Damnation Portals, Bosium Loops, Runeforge, and Curse of Shallow Graves.\n\nThat last map contained an innovation I still use today. Teleporting monsters into the map is a real pain since you have to set up a trigger, a teleporter, and a teleport destination, all of which need unique and correctly linked names. Curse of Shallow Graves teleports tons of monsters into the level by lining them up on a moving platform outside the map that slowly slides into a teleporter. That way, the monsters get teleported in one by one as they reach the teleporter.",

Since the recursive JSON structure can be a real pain to write by hand, this website makes things easy with convenient dropdowns and a much more appealing way to visualize the logic. It also includes other useful features for custom item design.\n\nA previous version of the website was made using Flutter.
